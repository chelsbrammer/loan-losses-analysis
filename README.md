# Loan Losses Analysis Project
## Chelsea Brammer - Capstone Project
This project is an analysis of UBPR data from all Missouri banks. While the data contains performance metrics from different areas, this analysis will focus on if loan growth rates have an impact on increased past due loans or loan losses. The author of the data is: https://www.bankperformancereport.com/ We receive an email from Bank Performance Report quarterly after they compile UBPR data of all Missouri banks from the FFIEC. 

The Uniform Bank Performance Report (UBPR) is an analytical tool created for bank supervisory, examination, and management purposes. In a concise format, it shows the impact of management decisions and economic conditions on a bank's performance and balance-sheet composition. The performance and composition data contained in the report can be used as an aid in evaluating the adequacy of earnings, liquidity, capital, asset and liability management, and growth management. Bankers and examiners alike can use this report to further their understanding of a bank's financial condition, and through such understanding, perform their duties more effectively. https://www.ffiec.gov/ubpr.htm
